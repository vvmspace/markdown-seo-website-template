# How to Use Markdown for Linear Algebra: Mathematical Notation Examples

See also: [How to Start Writing in Markdown](/how_to_start_writing_in_markdown)

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. When it comes to writing mathematical notation, Markdown, in combination with LaTeX, is an excellent tool. LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system that's widely used for technical and scientific documentation.

In this article, we'll cover how to use Markdown for linear algebra by providing examples of mathematical notation and their corresponding Markdown code.

## Basic Mathematical Notation

To include mathematical notation in Markdown, you typically use a combination of Markdown and LaTeX syntax. Inline mathematical expressions can be enclosed in single dollar signs (`$...$`), while block mathematical expressions are enclosed in double dollar signs (`$$...$$`).

### 1. Matrix Representation
To represent a matrix in Markdown, you can use LaTeX within a block element.

**Markdown Code:**
```markdown
$$
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \
\cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots \
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
```

**Rendered Output:**
$$
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \
\cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots \
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### 2. Vector Representation
Vectors can be represented in column form using LaTeX.

$$
\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
v_{1} \
v_{2} \
\cdots \
v_{n}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

**Markdown Code:**
```markdown
$$
\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
v_{1} \
v_{2} \
\cdots \
v_{n}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
```

Or in component form

**Markdown Code:**
```markdown
The vector $\vec{v}$ can be represented in component form as $\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}$.
```

**Rendered Output:**

The vector $\vec{v}$ can be represented in component form as $\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}$.


**Rendered Output:**
$$
\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
v_{1} \
v_{2} \
\cdots \
v_{n}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### 3. Dot Product
The dot product of two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ can be represented as follows:

**Markdown Code:**
```markdown
$$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i
$$
```

**Rendered Output:**
$$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i
$$

### 4. Matrix Multiplication
Matrix multiplication of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$:

**Markdown Code:**
```markdown
$$
\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}
$$

where

$$
\mathbf{C_ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \mathbf{A_ik} \mathbf{B_kj}
$$
```

**Rendered Output:**
$$
\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}
$$

where

$$
\mathbf{C_ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \mathbf{A_ik} \mathbf{B_kj}
$$

### 5. Determinant of a Matrix
The determinant of a 2x2 matrix $\mathbf{A}$:

**Markdown Code:**
```markdown
$$
\det(\mathbf{A}) = \begin{vmatrix}
a & b \
c & d
\end{vmatrix} = ad - bc
$$
```

**Rendered Output:**
$$
\det(\mathbf{A}) = \begin{vmatrix}
a & b \
c & d
\end{vmatrix} = ad - bc
$$

## Conclusion

Using Markdown with LaTeX for linear algebra notation allows you to create well-formatted, professional-looking documents. The examples provided in this article should give you a solid starting point for writing your own linear algebra documents in Markdown. Whether you're writing a research paper, a blog post, or documenting a project, these techniques will help you present your mathematical content clearly and effectively.

Remember to use single dollar signs for inline math and double dollar signs for block math, and leverage LaTeX for complex expressions and structures.
