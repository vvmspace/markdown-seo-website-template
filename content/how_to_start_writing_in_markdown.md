# How to Start Writing in Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to create formatted text using plain text. It is often used for writing documentation, blogs, and notes. In this article, we will explain how to start writing in Markdown.

## What is Markdown

Markdown was created by John Gruber in 2004 as a simple way to write HTML. It uses plain characters like asterisks, hashes, and dashes to format text. This makes Markdown accessible and easy to read even in its unformatted state.

## Basic Elements of Markdown

### Headers

To create headers, use hashes (`#`). The more hashes, the lower the level of the header.

```markdown
# Level 1 Header
## Level 2 Header
### Level 3 Header
```

### Paragraphs

To create a new paragraph, simply leave one empty line between blocks of text.

### Lists

#### Numbered Lists

To create numbered lists, use numbers followed by a period.

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

#### Bulleted Lists

To create bulleted lists, use asterisks, pluses, or dashes.

```markdown
- List item
- Another item
- And another
```

### Text Formatting

- **Bold text**: wrap the text with two asterisks or two underscores (`**text**` or `__text__`).
- *Italic text*: wrap the text with one asterisk or one underscore (`*text*` or `_text_`).
- `Monospaced text`: wrap the text with backticks (`` `text` ``).

### Links

To create links, use the following syntax: `[link text](URL)`.

```

### Images

To add images, use an exclamation mark before the link syntax: `![alt text](image URL)`.

```markdown
![Example image](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

### Blockquotes

To create blockquotes, use the greater-than symbol (`>`).

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

### Code Blocks

To create code blocks, use three backticks before and after the code block.

\```markdown
Code goes here
\```

### Horizontal Line

To create a horizontal line, use three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores.

```markdown

```
