# How to Host an Obsidian Markdown Website on Netlify Using Hugo and the SEO-Optimized Hugo Theme


Hosting a website using Obsidian, Hugo, and Netlify offers a streamlined, efficient way to build a web presence with excellent SEO capabilities. This guide will take you through the steps of setting up a Markdown-based website using the highly SEO-optimized Hugo theme available at [vvmspace/hugo-seo-theme](https://github.com/vvmspace/hugo-seo-theme). This theme is specifically designed to handle Markdown files seamlessly, either with or without additional Hugo markup, making it ideal for both beginners and advanced users who aim for top-notch SEO performance. Additionally, it supports tags that enhance page interlinking, crucial for building a robust semantic core.

## Step 1: Extracting Markdown Files from Obsidian
First, you need to extract your Markdown files from Obsidian. Obsidian stores your notes as Markdown files, so you can directly use these files for your website. Alternatively, configure Obsidian to point its content directory to where you'll store your website's content, simplifying the workflow.

## Step 2: Creating a Hugo Site
Install Hugo on your system and create a new site by running:
```bash
hugo new site my-obsidian-website
```
Replace `my-obsidian-website` with your preferred site name. This command sets up the basic structure of your Hugo site.

## Step 3: Setting Up a GitHub Repository for Your Hugo Website
Host your site's code on GitHub by creating a new repository. This will also facilitate the deployment process on Netlify. Ensure your repository is public if you want to leverage Netlify's free hosting service.

## Step 4: Using Tags for Enhanced SEO
Utilize tags in your Markdown files to improve SEO and link connectivity between pages. The vvmspace Hugo theme supports tags out of the box, which helps in forming a semantic core that enhances the discoverability of your content.

## Step 5: Deploying on Netlify
Link your GitHub repository to Netlify:
1. Log in to Netlify and select 'New Site from Git'.
2. Choose GitHub as the source for your site.
3. Select your repository and configure the build settings:
   - **Build command:** `hugo`
   - **Publish directory:** `public/`

Netlify will automatically deploy your site and update it on each commit to your repository.

## Step 6: Connecting a Domain
Connect your custom domain through Netlify by adding it in the domain management settings. Netlify provides detailed instructions to help you configure DNS settings with your domain registrar.

**Key Takeaways**
By following these steps, you can easily set up a Markdown-based website with excellent SEO potential. The vvmspace Hugo theme is particularly advantageous for SEO, allowing you to focus on creating quality content without worrying about technical SEO intricacies.

By the end of this process, not only will you have a fully functional, SEO-optimized website, but you will also have gained valuable skills in website deployment and management on modern platforms like Hugo and Netlify. Whether you're looking to share personal projects, professional portfolios, or engaging blogs, this setup ensures your site is built on a solid foundation, ready to attract and engage visitors.
