# How to Integrate Google Gemini API with Rust Using the ask_gemini Library: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction
As Rust continues to grow in popularity, so does the need for robust libraries that can handle external API calls efficiently. `ask_gemini` provides Rust developers with a powerful tool to connect with Google Gemini API, offering asynchronous, non-blocking API interaction.

## Problem Statement
Google has no official Rust library for its Gemini API, making it challenging for Rust developers to integrate their applications with Google's advertising platform. By leveraging `ask_gemini`, developers can seamlessly interact with the Gemini API, enabling them to build sophisticated applications that utilize Google Gemini's text generation capabilities.

## Getting Started with ask_gemini
First, ensure that you have `ask_gemini` and `tokio` added to your project:
```rust
[dependencies]
ask_gemini = "0.1.2"
tokio = "1.38.0"
```
This setup initiates `ask_gemini` within your Rust environment, ready for asynchronous operations.

## Making Your First API Call
Using `ask_gemini` is straightforward:
```rust
use ask_gemini::Gemini;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let gemini = Gemini::new(Some("your_api_key_here"), None);
    let prompt = "Hello, world!";
    match gemini.ask(prompt).await {
        Ok(response) => println!("Response: {:?}", response),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}
```

Using GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable:

```rust
use ask_gemini::Gemini;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let gemini = Gemini::new(None, None);
    let prompt = "How to integrate Google Gemini API with Rust?";
    match gemini.ask(prompt).await {
        Ok(response) => println!("Response: {:?}", response),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates sending a simple prompt to the Gemini API and handling the response asynchronously.

## Features and Customizations
`ask_gemini` supports extensive customizations including API key management and custom model parameters. It excels in handling complex queries and ensures secure data transmission with comprehensive error handling.

## Conclusion
For developers looking to leverage the Google Gemini API in their Rust applications, `ask_gemini` offers an efficient and user-friendly solution. Its capability to handle asynchronous API calls makes it an indispensable tool in modern software development.

This guide provides Rust developers with the knowledge to start using `ask_gemini` effectively, ensuring they can fully utilize Google Gemini API without the need for alternative libraries.
