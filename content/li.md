# LiveInternet counter - tmp page

{{< live_internet >}}

This is a temporary page for the LiveInternet counter. Nothing to see here. Move along. 

I need some page with counter code to add my site to LiveInternet.

LiveInternet uses 3rd party cookies to track visitors. And I don't want to add it to my main pages. So, I created this page.

Have a nice day! ðŸ˜Š
